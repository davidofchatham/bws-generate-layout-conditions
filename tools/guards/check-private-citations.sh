# Fail if a committed file cites a private path.
#
# .scratch/ and .claude/ resolve for exactly one person. A committed file pointing
# there fails SILENTLY for every other reader: it looks like a working pointer, so
# nothing ever reports it.
#
# Cite a live plan through its FW-N row in docs/future-work.md.
#
# WHAT IS NOT A VIOLATION: naming the CONVENTION. docs/agents/ has to write
# ".scratch/<slug>/spec.md" to describe the layout at all, so a path containing
# a <placeholder> or a * glob is a pattern, not a citation. Only fully literal paths
# are citations, and only those fail.
#
# ONE EXEMPTION: docs/future-work.md -- the tracker IS the sanctioned index over
# private homes. Pointing at them is its entire job; docs/agents/issue-tracker.md
# makes it the readable surface everything else cites instead. It is the one file
# allowed to hold the path, which is exactly what lets every other file be held to
# the rule.
#
# Copy-in template. Adapted from a private project's scripts/check-private-citations.sh (read 2026-10-02);
# the adaptations are listed in the body of the commit that added this file (git log -- tools/guards/).
# Why each rule looks the way it does: the bws-reference practice committed-content-guards.md.
# Usage: bash tools/guards/check-private-citations.sh

# A literal path: no '<', no '*'. Anchored on a .md so a bare directory mention
# ("no copy stays under .scratch/plans/") is prose, not a pointer. Matches
# any .claude/ subtree, not just .claude/plans/ -- the private harness tree has
# several and all are equally unreadable to anyone else.

# git grep exits 1 for "no matches" and >1 for a real error. Collapsing both to

# the same silent-failure class it exists to catch, one level up.
